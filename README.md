E-Commerce Website


# Our Goals
We are willing to revolutionize the way E-Commerce works with our website Blimp.com (witch happens to be this project in particular). Our goal is to make a quality and good looking website, where customers can find specific items, look at the trends or just get some idea of what people have to offer. Sellers can use it to promote and sell their products /(wherever they make it or reselling old stuff laying around in a corner of their room) or services/. We hope that you will find the following remix of the dictionnary somehow interesting.

# How it Works
/Basically, we want to make a website on witch anybody could sell a product. We don't want to use the usual method of just displaying a bunch of products to the customer and expect him to just choose some. The main ways of finding a products are either going into a niche, l'ets say men's clothing, and I find a cool tank top that I decide to buy, searching for the item on the search bar and looking down at the results or when looking at your recommended page, that will be on the "For you" page. For selling, on your account the seller will be able to click on a button "Sell Item" and specify the niche, price and specific information. All items that are currently still in sale will appear in the seller's account, under "Selling Here" NOT FINISHED
