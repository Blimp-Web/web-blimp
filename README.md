E-Commerce Website
#### **Our Goals**

We are willing to revolutionize the way E-Commerce works with our website Blimp.com (which happens to be this project in particular). Our goal is to make a quality and good looking website, where customers can find specific items, look at the trends or just get some idea of what people have to offer. Sellers can use it to promote and sell their products /(wherever they make it or reselling old stuff lying around in a corner of their room) or services/. If you want to contribute or contact us, you can do it with the email: ecom.blimp@gmail.com or go take a look at the CONTRIBUTE.md file.

#### **How it Works**

/Basically, we want to make a website on witch anybody could sell a product. We don't want to use the usual method of just displaying a bunch of products to the customer and expect him to just choose some. The main ways of finding a products are either going into a niche, let’s say men's clothing, and I find a cool tank top that I decide to buy, searching for the item on the search bar and looking down at the results or when looking at your recommended page, that will be on the "For you" page. For selling, on your account the seller will be able to click on a button "Sell Item" and specify the niche, price and specific information. All items that are currently still in sale will appear in the seller's account, under the "Selling Here" section.

**Niches and product boxes**

Customers can find items by scrolling down in a specific niche, and choosing from the choices that appear. Choices will be displayed one by one, in a vertical rounded-up rectangle, with the name of the article, price and discount, an image, View More button, Add to Cart button, Like button and Share button.

**Search Bar**

When searching for a specific item, customers may use the Search Bar. Like all other search bars, customers type in what they are looking for and click on Search. They can choose in the results that will show up.

**For You**

The "For You" page contains products similar to those that have previously been liked or bought by the costumer or items from the niches that have been set as "Favourite Niches" in the creation of the customer's account.
